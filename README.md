# Language Pattern Analysis Using Machine Learning Clustering
hierarchical clustering of 255 languages using Hamming distance on linguistic features from WALS. Applied Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for network analysis. Evaluated neural network classifiers on non-linear data. Explored potential of large language models to reduce bias in hiring and education.
